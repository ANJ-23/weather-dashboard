# Weather Search Dashboard

## Description

This weather dashboard searches for a city, which in turn gathers weather information on that city. Information includes temperature, wind speed, humidity, and an icon to indiate the skies - all spanning from the current time to the next 5 days. Previously searched cities also appear as a button below the search bar; pressing a city's respective button automatically gathers its weather data.

This was created using JavaScript APIs fetches (specifically in OpenWeather API), jQuery attributes and appends, and Bootstrap to dynamically generate data.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Open the website (<https://anj-23.github.io/weather-dashboard/>) and type in the name of a city in the search bar. Then, press the "Search" button to obtain today's weather and a 5-day weather forcast of the city.

Previous search entries appear as a button below the search bar - akin to a search history. Pressing a button in the search history gathers weather data from the city that it lists.
